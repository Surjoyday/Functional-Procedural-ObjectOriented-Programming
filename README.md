### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Data and related functions (methods)** are bundled together inside **objects**.

### Procedural Programming (PP)
- **Functions and data** are separate, with functions acting on data passed to them.

### Functional Programming (FP)
- **Functions operate on data**, but the focus is on using **pure functions** that return new data without modifying the original.

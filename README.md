# OOP

- In object-oriented programming (OOP), we organize code into distinct entities called classes or objects. Each entity is designed to serve a specific purpose and encapsulates both data and behavior related to that purpose. This approach helps in managing complexity by promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
